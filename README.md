## About Me
🎓 I am a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill studying computer science. I have a deep interest in computer science because I enjoy solving problems and want to build things that work efficiently and help make people's everyday life easier. I like computer science as it can be applied to real world problems and solve those problems in a creative and effective way. 

🤖 I am interested in pursuing a career as a Software engineer or Web developer. 

🌱 In my free time, I enjoy trying a lot of different things. I enjoy doing nails, learning new songs on guitar, cooking, travelling and camping with my friends and family. 





## Classes
🏫 I learned the basics of programming such as data types, functions and object oriented programming in python language in my comp 110 class which is an intro to programming and data science class. Currently I am learning Java in comp 210 which is a data structures and analysis class. I am also enrolled in comp 290 that teaches special topics in computer science. In this class, we learn how to work with Git, Github and Docker.
